## ðŸ“– Usage

```shell
$ maex
Usage: maex <index> [<output>]
```

Where `<index>` is the path to the index JSON file, and `<output>` is the output directory where the assets will be extracted to. If `<output>` is not specified, the assets will be extracted to a directory next to the executable, with timestamp as the name.

Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/maex) for using this crate as a library.

## ðŸ“‚ Assets Folder

The `assets` folder, usually located directly under `.minecraft`, consists of 3 folders:

- `index`: This folder contains several JSON files for indexing the assets, each for a specific game version. Each JSON file contains a single key `objects` at the top level, which is a map of asset paths to their corresponding hash and size.
- `objects`: This folder contains the actual assets, which are stored in a hashed format. Specifically, denote the hash as `hash`, the asset will be stored in `objects/hash[0..2]/hash`.
- `skins`: Structured like `objects`, containing skin images, but I don't know where their indices are stored.
